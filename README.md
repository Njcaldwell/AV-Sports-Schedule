# AV-Sports-Schedule

This is a project I started to work on to be able to take the JSON request from an API and create organized game cards. It will have a back end data base and a user login with the ability to edit the Sat box #. This will reduce the time it takes for the staff to create a readable sports schedule and assign to exising sat boxes.
